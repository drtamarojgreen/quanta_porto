[DOCUMENT CONTENT]
QuantaPorto is a framework for local LLM development. It uses an XML-based language called PQL to define tasks. The system enforces rules and consequences to guide the model's behavior, promoting reflection over simple task completion. It runs entirely offline, using a local GGML model, and relies on shell scripts and standard tools like xmlstarlet for its core logic. The goal is to create a more controlled and interpretable cognitive development environment for AI.

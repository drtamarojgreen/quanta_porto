# QuantaPorto Ethical Framework

## Our Principles

At QuantaPorto, we are guided by the following principles in our approach to AI ethics and bias mitigation:

1.  **Fairness:** We strive to build AI systems that are fair and equitable to all users, regardless of their background or identity.
2.  **Transparency:** We are committed to being transparent about our efforts to mitigate bias. We will publish our bias detection rules and regularly report on our progress in this area.
3.  **Accountability:** We take responsibility for the impact of our AI systems. We have established a clear process for addressing ethical violations and ensuring that our systems are held to the highest standards.
4.  **Privacy:** We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We will not use our AI systems to collect or store personally identifiable information without their consent.
5.  **Safety:** We are committed to building AI systems that are safe and reliable. We will take steps to prevent our systems from being used to cause harm.

## Our Approach

Our approach to AI ethics and bias mitigation is multi-faceted and includes the following key components:

### 1.  Rule-Based Bias Detection

We have developed a set of rules to detect and flag potentially biased or unethical language in the LLM's output. These rules are designed to identify a wide range of biases, including but not limited to:

*   Gender bias
*   Racial and ethnic bias
*   Ageism
*   Ableism
*   Political bias
*   Socioeconomic bias
*   Religious bias

### 2.  Continuous Monitoring and Polling

We have implemented a continuous monitoring system that will periodically poll the LLM's output and run it against our bias detection rules. This will allow us to identify and address issues in near real-time.

### 3.  Consequence Management

When a potential bias or ethical violation is detected, our system will take one or more of the following actions:

*   **Flag the output:** The output will be flagged for human review.
*   **Re-prompt the LLM:** The LLM will be re-prompted with a modified version of the original input that is designed to elicit a more neutral and unbiased response.
*   **Taint the output:** The output will be "tainted" to track the spread of biased language through the system.
*   **Log the violation:** The violation will be logged for further analysis and to help us improve our bias detection rules.

### 4.  Human-in-the-Loop

We have established a human-in-the-loop process for reviewing and addressing ethical violations. This process includes the following steps:

1.  A potential violation is flagged by our system.
2.  The violation is reviewed by a human moderator.
3.  The moderator determines the appropriate course of action, which may include:
    *   Editing or removing the biased content.
    *   Providing feedback to the LLM.
    *   Escalating the issue to a higher level of review.

### 5.  Regular Audits

We will conduct regular audits of our AI systems to identify and address potential biases. These audits will be conducted by an independent third party.

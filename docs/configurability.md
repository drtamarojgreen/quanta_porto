# Configurability Enhancement Opportunities

This document outlines areas where hardcoded values can be externalized into a configuration system. Improving configurability is essential for deploying the application across different environments (development, staging, production) without code changes.

---

### 1. Externalize Server Port

*   **Observation:** The network port (`3000`) is hardcoded in the server startup script.
*   **Suggestion:** Read the port from an environment variable (e.g., `PORT`). Provide a sensible default for local development. This is standard practice for most hosting platforms.
    *   Example: `const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;`

### 2. Centralize Configuration Management

*   **Observation:** The application has several hardcoded values scattered throughout the codebase, such as the database connection string, API keys for external services, and JWT secrets.
*   **Suggestion:** Create a single, centralized configuration module (e.g., `config/index.js`). This module should be responsible for reading all environment variables and exporting them as a unified configuration object. This makes it clear what values are configurable and provides a single source of truth.

### 3. Make Logging Configurable

*   **Observation:** The logging level is static. In production, verbose `debug` logs can be noisy and costly, while in development, they are essential.
*   **Suggestion:** Allow the log level to be set via an environment variable, such as `LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., 'debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error').

### 4. Introduce Feature Flags

*   **Observation:** New features are deployed directly to all users. There is no mechanism for a phased rollout or for quickly disabling a problematic feature in production.
*   **Suggestion:** Implement a simple feature flag system using the configuration module. A feature can be enabled or disabled by setting an environment variable (e.g., `ENABLE_BETA_FEATURE=true`). This allows for greater control over deployments and reduces risk.

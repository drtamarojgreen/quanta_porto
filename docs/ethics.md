# QuantaPorto Ethics and Bias Enhancement

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive enhancement of QuantaPorto's ethics and bias detection system. The enhancement introduces advanced multi-method bias detection, integrated pipeline processing, and comprehensive testing frameworks to ensure responsible AI deployment.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Ethics and Bias Detection System

#### New Components
- **`scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh`**: Standalone ethics and bias detection tool
- **`scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh`**: Enhanced task manager with integrated ethics checking
- **`tests/bdd/enhanced_test_runner.sh`**: Advanced BDD test runner for ethics validation

#### Detection Methods
1. **Pattern-Based Detection**: Direct matching of known bias patterns
2. **Implicit Bias Detection**: Contextual analysis for subtle biases
3. **Intersectional Bias Detection**: Recognition of compound discrimination
4. **Coded Language Detection**: Identification of discriminatory coded language

### 2. Comprehensive Bias Categories

The system now detects and mitigates:

- **Gender Bias**: Stereotypes, role assumptions, implicit gender bias
- **Racial/Ethnic Bias**: Stereotypes, cultural appropriation, racial profiling
- **Ageism**: Age-based stereotypes for both older and younger individuals
- **Ableism**: Disability discrimination and problematic language
- **Socioeconomic Bias**: Class-based stereotypes and educational discrimination
- **Religious Bias**: Religious stereotypes and discriminatory language
- **Intersectional Bias**: Compound discrimination across multiple identities
- **Microaggressions**: Subtle discriminatory language and backhanded compliments

### 3. Severity-Based Response System

#### Severity Levels and Scoring
- **Low (1-3 points)**: Minor issues, warnings logged
- **Medium (4-6 points)**: Moderate bias, mitigation triggered
- **High (7-10 points)**: Significant bias, immediate flagging
- **Critical (11+ points)**: Severe violations, immediate timeout

#### Scoring Algorithm
- Racial/gender stereotypes: 10 points
- Implicit bias and coded language: 7 points
- Ageism and ableism: 5 points
- Other bias types: 3 points
- Intersectional bias: Compound scoring

### 4. Integrated Pipeline Processing

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Bash shell environment

### Windows Setup
Since this is a Windows environment, you'll need to run the scripts through a bash-compatible environment like:
- Git Bash
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Cygwin
- MSYS2

### Script Permissions
The shell scripts in this project are checked into the repository with execute permissions. If you encounter a "Permission denied" error, you can restore the permissions with the following command:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh tests/bdd/*.sh
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Ethics and Bias Checker

#### Basic Usage
The `ethics_bias_checker.sh` script can process text from a command-line argument or from standard input (pipe).

```bash
# Check text from an argument
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --text "Your text here"

# Check content piped from another command
echo "Your text here" | ./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh

# Get JSON output for integration
echo "Your text here" | ./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --json
```

#### Example Output
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    "gender_stereotype_male:men are better at",
    "implicit_gender_bias:assumption_language"
  ],
  "severity_score": 17,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider using gender-neutral language and avoiding assumptions about gender roles",
    "Question assumptions and consider alternative perspectives"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Task Manager

#### Basic Usage
The `enhanced_task_manager.sh` script takes a prompt as input from the command line or standard input.

```bash
# Run with a prompt from an argument
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh "Your prompt here"

# Run with a prompt piped from another command
echo "Your prompt here" | ./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh
```

### 3. BDD Testing

#### Running Ethics Tests
```bash
# Navigate to BDD test directory
cd tests/bdd

# Run all tests
./enhanced_test_runner.sh

# Run with verbose output
./enhanced_test_runner.sh --verbose
```

#### Test Categories
- **Ethics Detection Tests**: Comprehensive bias detection scenarios
- **Pipeline Integration Tests**: End-to-end ethics integration testing
- **Mitigation Tests**: Validation of bias correction mechanisms
- **Performance Tests**: Ethics checking overhead monitoring

## Configuration Files

### 1. Enhanced Ethics Rules (`rules/ethics_rules.csv`)
Defines enforcement logic with a pipe-delimited format:
```
rule_id|severity|condition|consequences
```

Example:
```
bias_detection|high|toxic_language|reprompt,flag_for_review
```

### 2. Bias Patterns (`rules/bias_patterns.txt`)
Auto-generated file containing detailed bias detection patterns:
```
# Gender Bias Patterns
gender_stereotype_male|men are better at|boys are naturally|masculine traits include
gender_stereotype_female|women are naturally|girls should be|feminine traits include

# Racial and Ethnic Bias Patterns
racial_stereotype|all [race/ethnicity] people|typical [race/ethnicity] behavior
```

## BDD Test Features

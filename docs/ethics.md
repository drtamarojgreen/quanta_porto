# QuantaPorto Ethics and Bias Enhancement

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive enhancement of QuantaPorto's ethics and bias detection system. The enhancement introduces advanced multi-method bias detection, integrated pipeline processing, and comprehensive testing frameworks to ensure responsible AI deployment.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Ethics and Bias Detection System

#### New Components
- **`scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh`**: Standalone ethics and bias detection tool
- **`scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh`**: Enhanced task manager with integrated ethics checking
- **`tests/bdd/enhanced_test_runner.sh`**: Advanced BDD test runner for ethics validation

#### Detection Methods
1. **Pattern-Based Detection**: Direct matching of known bias patterns
2. **Implicit Bias Detection**: Contextual analysis for subtle biases
3. **Intersectional Bias Detection**: Recognition of compound discrimination
4. **Coded Language Detection**: Identification of discriminatory coded language

### 2. Comprehensive Bias Categories

The system now detects and mitigates:

- **Gender Bias**: Stereotypes, role assumptions, implicit gender bias
- **Racial/Ethnic Bias**: Stereotypes, cultural appropriation, racial profiling
- **Ageism**: Age-based stereotypes for both older and younger individuals
- **Ableism**: Disability discrimination and problematic language
- **Socioeconomic Bias**: Class-based stereotypes and educational discrimination
- **Religious Bias**: Religious stereotypes and discriminatory language
- **Intersectional Bias**: Compound discrimination across multiple identities
- **Microaggressions**: Subtle discriminatory language and backhanded compliments

### 3. Severity-Based Response System

#### Severity Levels and Scoring
- **Low (1-3 points)**: Minor issues, warnings logged
- **Medium (4-6 points)**: Moderate bias, mitigation triggered
- **High (7-10 points)**: Significant bias, immediate flagging
- **Critical (11+ points)**: Severe violations, immediate timeout

#### Scoring Algorithm
- Racial/gender stereotypes: 10 points
- Implicit bias and coded language: 7 points
- Ageism and ableism: 5 points
- Other bias types: 3 points
- Intersectional bias: Compound scoring

### 4. Integrated Pipeline Processing

#### Enhanced Task Manager Features
- Real-time ethics checking for all AI outputs
- Automatic bias mitigation prompting
- Configurable retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts)
- Comprehensive violation logging
- Configurable severity thresholds

#### Enforcement Actions
- **Flag for Review**: Non-critical violations logged for human review
- **Immediate Timeout**: Critical violations trigger AI timeout
- **Mitigation Prompting**: Automatic generation of corrective prompts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed violation tracking

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Bash shell environment
- `jq` for JSON processing (required for ethics tests)
- `xmlstarlet` for XML validation (optional, for PQL tests)

### Windows Setup
Since this is a Windows environment, you'll need to run the scripts through a bash-compatible environment like:
- Git Bash
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Cygwin
- MSYS2

### Making Scripts Executable (Linux/Mac/WSL)
```bash
chmod +x scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh
chmod +x scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh
chmod +x tests/bdd/enhanced_test_runner.sh
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Ethics and Bias Checker

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Check text for bias violations
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --text "Your text here"

# Check file content
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --file input.txt

# Get JSON output for integration
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --text "Your text here" --json
```

#### Example Output
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    "gender_stereotype_male:men are better at",
    "implicit_gender_bias:assumption_language"
  ],
  "severity_score": 17,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider using gender-neutral language and avoiding assumptions about gender roles",
    "Question assumptions and consider alternative perspectives"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Task Manager

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run with default settings
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh

# Enable strict ethics mode (zero tolerance)
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh --ethics-strict

# Set custom bias threshold
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh --bias-threshold 8

# Disable automatic bias mitigation
./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh --disable-bias-mitigation
```

#### Configuration Options
- `--ethics-strict`: Enable zero-tolerance ethics mode
- `--bias-threshold N`: Set severity threshold (default: 5)
- `--disable-bias-mitigation`: Disable automatic mitigation prompts

### 3. BDD Testing

#### Running Ethics Tests
```bash
# Navigate to BDD test directory
cd tests/bdd

# Run all tests
./enhanced_test_runner.sh

# Run with verbose output
./enhanced_test_runner.sh --verbose

# Run only ethics-related tests
./enhanced_test_runner.sh --filter "ethics"

# Run tests in parallel
./enhanced_test_runner.sh --parallel --jobs 4
```

#### Test Categories
- **Ethics Detection Tests**: Comprehensive bias detection scenarios
- **Pipeline Integration Tests**: End-to-end ethics integration testing
- **Mitigation Tests**: Validation of bias correction mechanisms
- **Performance Tests**: Ethics checking overhead monitoring

## Configuration Files

### 1. Enhanced Ethics Rules (`config/ethics_rules.txt`)
Defines enforcement logic with enhanced format:
```
rule_id|condition|consequence|severity|mitigation_strategy
```

Example:
```
gender_stereotype_male|output contains "men are better at"|flag_for_review|high|gender_neutral_language
racial_stereotype|output contains "all [race] people"|immediate_timeout|critical|cultural_sensitivity_training
```

### 2. Bias Patterns (`config/bias_patterns.txt`)
Auto-generated file containing detailed bias detection patterns:
```
# Gender Bias Patterns
gender_stereotype_male|men are better at|boys are naturally|masculine traits include
gender_stereotype_female|women are naturally|girls should be|feminine traits include

# Racial and Ethnic Bias Patterns
racial_stereotype|all [race/ethnicity] people|typical [race/ethnicity] behavior
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Pipeline Integration Points
1. **Task Processing**: Enhanced task manager replaces standard task manager
2. **Rule Validation**: Ethics checking integrated with existing rule system
3. **Logging**: Ethics logs complement existing violation logs
4. **Testing**: BDD tests extend existing test framework

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing rule files remain functional
- Traditional rule checking continues alongside ethics checking
- Existing scripts can gradually adopt enhanced task manager
- Configuration files are additive, not replacing

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Efficient pattern matching algorithms
- Configurable checking intensity
- Parallel test execution
- Caching of bias pattern compilations

### Performance Monitoring
- Ethics checking overhead measurement
- Processing time tracking
- Throughput impact assessment
- Resource usage monitoring

## Customization and Extension

### Adding New Bias Patterns
1. Edit `config/bias_patterns.txt`
2. Add patterns in format: `category|pattern1|pattern2|pattern3`
3. Update corresponding rules in `config/ethics_rules.txt`
4. Add BDD test scenarios for new patterns

### Custom Mitigation Strategies
1. Extend `generate_mitigation_prompt()` function in enhanced task manager
2. Add new mitigation types to ethics rules configuration
3. Create corresponding test scenarios

### Industry-Specific Configurations
1. Create custom bias pattern files for specific domains
2. Adjust severity thresholds for regulatory compliance
3. Implement domain-specific mitigation strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Error**: `jq: command not found`
**Solution**: Install jq JSON processor
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install jq

# macOS
brew install jq

# Windows (via Chocolatey)
choco install jq
```

#### 2. Script Execution Permissions
**Error**: Permission denied when running scripts
**Solution**: Make scripts executable (Linux/Mac/WSL)
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh tests/bdd/*.sh
```

#### 3. Ethics Checker Not Found
**Error**: Ethics checker script not found
**Solution**: Ensure script exists and is in correct location
```bash
ls -la scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh
```

#### 4. JSON Parsing Errors
**Error**: Invalid JSON output from ethics checker
**Solution**: Check for syntax errors in bias patterns file
```bash
./scripts/ethics_bias_checker.sh --text "test" --json | jq .
```

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Enhanced task manager with debug output
VERBOSE=true ./scripts/enhanced_task_manager.sh

Feature: Ethics and Bias Detection

  As a responsible AI system
  I want to detect and prevent ethical violations and biased content
  So that the system produces fair, inclusive, and ethical outputs

  Background:
    Given the ethics and bias detection system is initialized
    And the bias patterns configuration is loaded

  Scenario: Detect gender bias in output
    Given an LLM output containing gender stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect gender bias violations
    And the violation should be categorized as "gender_stereotype"
    And the severity score should be greater than 5
    And mitigation suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: Detect racial bias in output
    Given an LLM output containing racial stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect racial bias violations
    And the violation should be categorized as "racial_stereotype"
    And the severity score should be greater than 8
    And the violation should be logged for review

  Scenario: Detect implicit bias through coded language
    Given an LLM output containing coded language about minorities
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect implicit bias violations
    And the violation should be categorized as "coded_language"
    And appropriate mitigation suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: Detect intersectional bias
    Given an LLM output containing intersectional bias indicators
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect intersectional bias violations
    And the violation should include multiple identity markers
    And the severity score should reflect compound bias effects

  Scenario: Pass clean content through ethics check
    Given an LLM output with inclusive and unbiased content
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should pass the content
    And no violations should be detected
    And the severity score should be 0

  Scenario: Handle ageism detection
    Given an LLM output containing age-based stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect ageism violations
    And appropriate age-inclusive suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: Handle ableism detection
    Given an LLM output containing disability stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect ableism violations
    And person-first language suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: Severity threshold enforcement
    Given an LLM output with minor bias indicators
    And the bias threshold is set to 10
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect violations
    But the severity should not exceed the threshold
    And no enforcement action should be triggered

  Scenario: Critical violation handling
    Given an LLM output with severe racial stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect critical violations
    And the severity score should exceed 15
    And immediate enforcement action should be recommended

  Scenario: Multiple violation types in single output
    Given an LLM output containing both gender and racial bias
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect multiple violation types
    And each violation should be properly categorized
    And the combined severity score should reflect all violations
    And comprehensive mitigation suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: JSON output format validation
    Given an LLM output containing bias violations
    When I run the ethics and bias checker with JSON output
    Then the output should be valid JSON
    And it should contain status, violations, severity_score, and suggestions fields
    And the violations array should list all detected issues

  Scenario: Bias pattern configuration loading
    Given a custom bias patterns configuration file
    When the ethics and bias checker initializes
    Then it should load the custom patterns
    And detect violations based on the custom configuration

  Scenario: Ethics violation logging
    Given an LLM output containing ethics violations
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the violations should be logged with timestamps
    And the log should include violation details and suggestions
    And the log format should be consistent and parseable

  Scenario: Mitigation suggestion generation
    Given various types of bias violations
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then appropriate mitigation suggestions should be generated for each violation type
    And suggestions should be specific to the violation category
    And suggestions should be actionable and clear

  Scenario: Cultural bias detection
    Given an LLM output containing cultural assumptions
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect cultural bias violations
    And suggestions for cultural sensitivity should be provided

  Scenario: Religious bias detection
    Given an LLM output containing religious stereotypes
    When I run the ethics and bias checker
    Then the checker should detect religious bias violations
    And the violation should be categorized appropriately
    And interfaith sensitivity suggestions should be provided

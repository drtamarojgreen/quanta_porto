Feature: Ethics and Bias Pipeline Integration

  As a QuantaPorto system administrator
  I want ethics and bias checking integrated into the task processing pipeline
  So that all AI outputs are automatically screened for ethical compliance

  Background:
    Given the enhanced task manager is configured
    And the ethics and bias checker is available
    And the pipeline integration is enabled

  Scenario: Process task with clean output
    Given a task queue with a simple, unbiased task
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then the task should complete successfully
    And no ethics violations should be detected
    And the output should be saved to the output directory
    And the task should be removed from the queue

  Scenario: Process task with bias violations and successful mitigation
    Given a task queue with a task that initially produces biased output
    And bias mitigation is enabled
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then the system should detect bias violations on the first attempt
    And the system should apply bias mitigation prompting
    And the system should retry with mitigation instructions
    And the final output should pass ethics checks
    And the task should complete successfully after retries

  Scenario: Process task with persistent ethics violations
    Given a task queue with a task that consistently produces biased output
    And the maximum retry limit is set to 3
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then the system should detect violations on each attempt
    And the system should retry up to the maximum limit
    And the system should put the AI into timeout after max retries
    And the violations should be logged with details
    And the task should remain in the queue

  Scenario: Strict ethics mode enforcement
    Given the enhanced task manager is configured with strict ethics mode
    And a task that produces minor bias violations
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then even minor violations should trigger enforcement
    And the system should apply immediate mitigation
    And no tolerance should be shown for any bias

  Scenario: Bias threshold configuration
    Given the enhanced task manager is configured with bias threshold 8
    And a task that produces output with severity score 6
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then the violations should be detected but not trigger enforcement
    And the task should complete with warnings logged
    And the output should be saved with violation annotations

  Scenario: Critical violation immediate timeout
    Given a task that produces severe racial stereotypes
    When the enhanced task manager processes the task
    Then critical violations should be detected immediately
    And the system should put the AI into timeout without retries
    And the violation should be logged as critical
    And appropriate authorities should be notified

  Scenario: Multiple tasks with mixed ethics compliance
    Given a task queue with multiple tasks of varying ethics compliance
    When the enhanced task manager processes the queue
    Then compliant tasks should process normally
    And non-compliant tasks should trigger mitigation
    And the queue should continue processing after handling violations
    And each task should be handled according to its compliance level

  Scenario: Ethics violation logging and monitoring
    Given tasks that produce various types of ethics violations
    When the enhanced task manager processes these tasks
    Then all violations should be logged with timestamps
    And violation types should be categorized correctly
    And severity scores should be recorded
    And mitigation attempts should be tracked
    And the logs should be available for analysis

  Scenario: Bias mitigation prompt generation
    Given a task that produces gender bias violations
    When the enhanced task manager applies mitigation
    Then the mitigation prompt should include gender-neutral language instructions
    And the prompt should reference the specific violations detected
    And the prompt should provide clear guidance for improvement
    And the original task context should be preserved

  Scenario: Timeout recovery and resumption
    Given the AI is in timeout due to ethics violations
    And the timeout period has expired
    When the enhanced task manager is invoked
    Then the timeout should be cleared automatically
    And normal task processing should resume
    And the timeout event should be logged

  Scenario: Ethics checker integration failure handling
    Given the ethics and bias checker is unavailable
    When the enhanced task manager processes a task
    Then the system should detect the checker failure
    And the task should be flagged for manual review
    And the system should continue with traditional rule checking
    And the failure should be logged for investigation

  Scenario: Configuration validation and error handling
    Given invalid bias threshold configuration
    When the enhanced task manager starts
    Then the system should detect the invalid configuration
    And default values should be used
    And a warning should be logged about the configuration issue
    And the system should continue operating safely

  Scenario: Performance impact monitoring
    Given a large queue of tasks to process
    When the enhanced task manager processes tasks with ethics checking
    Then the processing time should be monitored
    And performance metrics should be logged
    And the ethics checking overhead should be measured
    And the system should maintain acceptable throughput

  Scenario: Ethics compliance reporting
    Given tasks processed over a time period
    When generating ethics compliance reports
    Then the report should include violation statistics
    And trends in ethics compliance should be identified
    And mitigation effectiveness should be measured
    And recommendations for improvement should be provided

  Scenario: Integration with existing rule enforcement
    Given traditional rules and new ethics rules are both configured
    When the enhanced task manager processes tasks
    Then both rule types should be checked
    And violations should be handled according to their severity
    And the enforcement actions should be coordinated
    And no conflicts should occur between rule systems

  Scenario: Emergency ethics override
    Given a critical ethics violation is detected
    And emergency override protocols are enabled
    When the violation triggers emergency procedures
    Then all AI processing should be immediately suspended
    And emergency contacts should be notified
    And the system should enter safe mode
    And manual intervention should be required to resume

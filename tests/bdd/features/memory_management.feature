Feature: Memory Management and Learning

  Scenario: Development lessons storage and retrieval
    Given development insights from project execution
    When I store lessons in development_lessons.txt
    Then the lessons should be persisted
    And they should be retrievable for future planning

  Scenario: Memory integration in planning pipeline
    Given stored development lessons
    And active planning requirements
    When I run the planning pipeline
    Then historical insights should be incorporated
    And planning decisions should reflect learned lessons

  Scenario: Memory-driven strategy updates
    Given accumulated development experience
    When I analyze memory contents for strategy
    Then actionable insights should be extracted
    And strategy recommendations should be generated

  Scenario: Reflective validation using memory
    Given historical execution patterns
    And current system state
    When I perform reflective validation
    Then memory should inform validation decisions
    And improvements should be suggested based on history

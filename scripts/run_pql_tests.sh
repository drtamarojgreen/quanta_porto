# This script orchestrates a test-and-remediate cycle for the LLM. It performs
# a series of tests to check for both PQL (task) compliance and ethical/bias
# compliance. Based on the outcomes of these tests, it applies a corresponding
# action:
#
# - PQL Pass -> Ethics Pass: A "reward" is applied, typically by assigning more
#   complex or interesting tasks to the LLM.
# - PQL Pass -> Ethics Fail: "Remediation" is applied, assigning tasks focused
#   on reinforcing ethical guidelines.
# - PQL Fail: A "soft consequence" is applied, such as switching to reflective
#   or philosophical tasks.
#
# This creates a feedback loop to guide the model's behavior over time.
